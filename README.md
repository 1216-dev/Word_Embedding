# Word_Embedding
In this project, we explore text classification by combining word embeddings generated using Gensim and supervised learning models. Word embeddings are dense vector representations of words that capture semantic relationships between them, allowing machine learning models to understand text in a more meaningful way than simple one-hot encodings.
